# Pause_in_Assetbuying
BACKGROUND:
While the Fed Chief continuosly sends a signal to the market that expansionary MP will be pursued, data shows that the Fed has stopped buying assets since June.  The agressive balance sheet expansion which lasted for about 3 months since March has been put to a hold. I investigate the short-term effect of the pause on the financial market.

AIM:
1) Visualisation of the variation in 10Y US bond yields and Fed's total assets
2) Visualisation of the variation in US stock market index returns and Fed's total assets
