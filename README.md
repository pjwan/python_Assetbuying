# Pause_in_Assetbuying_& FM
BACKGROUND:
While the Fed Chief continuosly sends a signal to the market that expansionary MP will be pursued, data shows that the Fed has stopped buying assets since June.  The agressive balance sheet expansion which lasted for about 3 months since March has been put to a hold. I investigate the short-term effect of the pause on the financial market.
